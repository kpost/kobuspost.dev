After my Plate adventure I started as a freelance software engineer with Rompslomp. Rompslomp is a financial service (bookkeeping) for SMBâ€™s in The Netherlands. At Rompslomp I work on the frontend, backend and devops development of the application, as well as a data engineer on the machine learning projects.
