Plate is a whitelabel CMS. With this web platform, partners (web agencies, designers, etc.) can build custom websites for their clients, by utilizing an extremely accessible templating engine. With the front-end based web editing environment, the websites they build are very easy to maintain by the end-users. As co-founder I was responsible for the technical and product development of the platform, in the role of CTO and full stack developer.

In 2023 I decided to leave the company to pursue other endeavors.
